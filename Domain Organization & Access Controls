I have followed these steps:

Start -> Administrative Tools -> Server Manager Roles -> Active Directory Domain Services -> Active Directory Users and Computers -> ad.daswebs.com -> Users

I right-clicked Users and selected New -> Group, typed “HRsec”, and clicked okay, and group type as security.

I did the same for “Accountingsec”. I moved the HRsec security group I created to the Human Resources folder and the Accountingsec security group to the Accounting folder.

I double-clicked on Accountingsec under Account, clicked on the Members tab, then added Brimlock Stones. I did the same for HRsec with Sergio Chanel.

Then for the rest of challenges:

Start -> Administrative Tools -> Group Policy Management

I added DasGroup then I pressed Edit DasGroup and then I have followed these steps:

Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Autoplay Policies

From here I enabled the option “Turn off AutoPlay” and selected “CD-ROM and removable media drives” from the drop-down menu.

Then..

Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Security Options

From here I selected “Interactive logon: Do not display last user name” and enabled it.

For the last options, I opened Windows Explorer and went to Network then File share. From here, I did right-click  on the Accounting folder.
I clicked the Security tab, clicked Continue, clicked Add, typed HRsec, and selected Check Names. Then I clicked okay. After that, I denied Read and Write access.
I did the same with Human Resources folder and I added Accountingsec and I also denied Read and Write access.
